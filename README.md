# MultiPhaseMixtureMedia
MultiPhaseMixtureMedia is a framework for thermodynamic properties in Modelica including an external C/C++ Modelica property interface with back ends to CAPE-OPEN, RefProp and FluidProp.
It consists of two parts:
  * MultiPhaseMixture - a Modelica library
  * ExternalMultiPhaseMixture -  a C/C++ interface to MultiPhaseMixture with backends to CAPE-OPEN 1.0, RefProp and FluidProp

For an overview of the framework, see the article [*MultiComponentMultiPhase - A Framework for Thermodynamic Properties in Modelica*](http://dx.doi.org/10.3384/ecp15118653)

MultiPhaseMixtureMedia is a free software and the use is completely at your own risk;

# Compilation, Supported Operating Systems and Modelica tools
  * The current version of MultiPhaseMixture has only been successfully tested with Dymola 2016
  * ExternalMultiPhaseMixture has only been tested on Windows 32-bit. The CAPE-OPEN backend is based on Windows COM technology and requires Visual Studio Professional to compile. Different backends can be disabled during the compilation by modifying lib/source/config.h. When a new version of externalmixturemedialib.lib has been compiled it should be moved to  MultiPhaseMixture/Resources/Library
